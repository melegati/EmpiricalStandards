# Qualitative surveys
<standard name="Interview Studies">


_<desc>Research aiming to identify the diversity of characteristic values, rather than measuring their distribution, in a targeted population</desc>_


## Application 

This standard applies to empirical inquiries that meet all of the
following criteria:

-   Researcher(s) have 

If respondents are all from the same organization, consider the **Case Study Standard**. 

## Specific Attributes

### Essential Attributes	
<checklist name="Essential">

<method>    
    
- [ ]	identifies the target population and defines the sampling strategy (see the [Sampling Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/supplements/Sampling.md))  
- [ ]   describes how data sources were selected (i.e., interviewees or respondents selected, documents collected)
- [ ]	describes how the data collection instrument(s) was/were created  
- [ ]   describes how different values for the characteristic(s) under study were individualized (e.g., thematic analysis, clustering)

    
<results>    
    
- [ ]	presents clear chain of evidence from data to findings (e.g. proposed values)
- [ ]	clearly answers the research question(s)
- [ ]	provides evidence that most, if not all, possible values of a characteristic are represented
    
<discussion>
    
 - [ ]   researchers reflect on their own possible biases
 - [ ]   identifies key issues under consideration
    
</checklist>
     
### Desirable Attributes	
<checklist name="Desirable">

- [ ]	provides supplemental materials including interview guide(s), coding schemes, coding examples, decision rules, or extended chain-of-evidence table(s)
- [ ]   describes questions asked in data collection: content of central questions, form of questions (e.g. open vs. closed)
- [ ]	includes highly diverse participants
- [ ]   describes the relationships and interactions between researchers and participants relevant to the research process
- [ ]	uses direct quotations extensively to support key points
- [ ]   identifies data recording methods (audio/visual), field notes or transcription processes used
- [ ]	synthesizes results into a new, mature, fully-developed and clearly articulated theory (or model, etc.) 
- [ ]   reflects on any alternative explanations of the findings
- [ ]	reflects on how researchers’ biases may have affected their analysis
- [ ]   describes any incentives or compensation, and provides assurance of relevant ethical processes of data collection and consent process as relevant
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes	
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]	employs multiple data sources (e.g., questionnaires, interviews, documents)
- [ ]	if analyzing qualitative data, uses multiple coders and analyzes inter-coder reliability (see [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/docs/supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md))
</checklist>

## General Quality Criteria

Survey studies should address quantitative quality criteria such
as **internal validity**, **construct validity**, **external validity**,
**reliability** and **objectivity** (see [Glossary](../glossary)).

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations

-   In a study of deaf software developers, the interviews are conducted
    via text messages.
-   In a study of sexual harassment at named organizations, detailed
    description of interviewees and direct quotations are omitted to
    protect participants.
-   In a study of barriers faced by gay developers, participants are all
    gay (but should be diverse on other dimensions).

## Antipatterns 

-   Interviewing a small number of similar people, creating the illusion
    of convergence and saturation
-   Mis-presenting a interview study as grounded theory or a case
    study.

## Invalid Criticisms 

-   Lack of quantitative data; causal analysis; objectivity, internal
    validity, reliability, or generalizability.
-   Lack of replicability or reproducibility; not releasing transcripts.
-   Lack of probability sampling, statistical generalizability or
    representativeness unless representative sampling was an explicit
    goal of the study.
-   Failure to apply grounded theory or case study practices. An interview study is not grounded theory or a case study.

## Notes 

-   An interview study generally has more interviews than a case study
    that triangulates across different kinds of data.
